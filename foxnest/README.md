## Overview

FoxNest is a decentralized pre-market trading platform built on blockchain technology through smart contracts. The platform provides a secure and transparent solution for users wanting to trade tokens before the TGE (Token Generation Event).

With FoxNest, investors can participate in early-stage markets while being protected by a collateral system and market pricing mechanisms.

## Key Features

- **Pre-TGE Trading**: Buy and sell tokens before they are officially issued
- **Collateral Mechanism**: Ensures trust and security in transactions
- **Automated Matching Engine**: Efficiently and fairly matches buy/sell orders
- **Position Management System**: Flexible management of buyer/seller positions
- **Settlement Mechanism**: Clear settlement process with protective measures
- **Fully Decentralized**: P2P transactions without intermediaries

## How It Works

### 1. Placing Orders (Open Orders)

- Users looking to buy or sell tokens place open orders with the required collateral
- The system stores order information on the blockchain, ready for the matching process

### 2. Order Matching

- The system automatically searches for and matches suitable buy/sell orders
- When orders are matched, an official order is created with two positions: buyer and seller
- These positions are stored on the blockchain and can be transferred

### 3. Exiting Positions

- Users holding buyer/seller positions can exit part or all of their position by creating new open orders
- When an open order is matched with another user:
  - For full matches: The new user completely replaces the position of the original user
  - For partial matches: A child order is created with the corresponding position
- Collateral from the new user is transferred to the user exiting the position

### 4. Settlement

- When reaching the settlement phase (after TGE), the seller is responsible for transferring the promised tokens to the buyer
- Upon completion of settlement, the seller receives back their collateral and the buyer's collateral
- The system specifies a time period for the seller to complete the settlement

### 5. Protection Mechanism

- If the seller fails to settle within the specified time period:
  - The system automatically cancels the order
  - The seller loses their deposited collateral
  - The seller's collateral is transferred to the buyer as compensation

## Technical Specifications

- **Platform**: Blockchain (Ethereum, BNB Chain...)
- **Architecture**: Smart contracts with audited security mechanisms
- **Interface**: Web app supporting cryptocurrency wallet connections
- **Security**: Multi-signature, time locks, and advanced protection mechanisms

## Benefits

- **For Investors**: Early access to potential tokens with protection mechanisms
- **For Projects**: Assess market demand and build early communities
- **For the Market**: Increase liquidity and efficiency in the pre-TGE market

## User Guide

1. **Connect Wallet**: Log in with your blockchain wallet
2. **Browse Market**: Search for tokens you're interested in
3. **Place Orders**: Create open orders with your desired quantity and price
4. **Manage Positions**: Monitor and manage your positions
5. **Settlement**: Complete your obligations when reaching the settlement phase
