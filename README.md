# Hermit Diagrams

A repository of PlantUML diagrams for various blockchain and financial systems architecture.

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of PlantUML (`.wsd`) diagram files that document the architecture, flows, and components of various systems. The diagrams serve as technical documentation for different projects related to blockchain, trading, and financial systems.

## Project Categories

### Pre-Market AMM

Diagrams for the W-Pre-market AMM (Automated Market Maker) system, a specialized AMM designed for pre-market tokens. The system enables trading of tokens before they are officially launched using a specialized bonding curve formula.

- Component diagrams
- Class diagrams
- Sequence diagrams
- State diagrams

### Trading Vault

Diagrams documenting the flows and architecture of a trading vault system, including:
- Deposit flows
- Withdrawal flows
- Trading vault flow sequences

### Hyperliquid

System architecture diagrams for the Hyperliquid protocol:
- Component diagrams
- Deployment diagrams
- Crawl system architecture

### Marketing Analytics System

Diagrams for a marketing analytics system:
- Component diagrams
- Deployment diagrams
- Sequence diagrams

### CV Collector

Diagrams for a CV collection system:
- Activity diagrams
- Flow diagrams
- Sequence diagrams

### Socket-Spin

Architecture diagrams for the Socket-Spin system.

## How to Use

1. Install PlantUML: https://plantuml.com/starting
2. Open the `.wsd` files with a PlantUML compatible viewer or editor
3. Generate diagrams using the PlantUML command line or plugins
